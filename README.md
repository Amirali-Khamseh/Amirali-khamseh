# 💫 About Me:

Hello! 👋 I’m Amir👨🏻‍💻. Currently, I am studying for my Master's in Web Engineering @ TU Chemnitz, and alongside my studies, I work as a frontend developer in the innovation department of an e-commerce content management and delivery company. 
My primary technology stack has been JavaScript and my go-to libraries/frameworks are React and Next.js. 
For now, my main focus is getting to know AWS and its services and taking my first steps toward becoming an AWS Cloud Developer before graduation🎯.
